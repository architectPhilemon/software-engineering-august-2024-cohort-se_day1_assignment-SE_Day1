#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to development and maintenance of high quality software systems.software engineering is important in tech industry by enabling creation of systems and software applications that power various aspects of modern life


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
-establishment of software engineering>as a discipline in the 1960s
-the development of programming languages e.g Fortran,C
-the advent of structured programming>in the 1970s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1: Requirements -gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements 
2: Design-creating high level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface 
3: Implementation -writing code and building the software according to the design specifications 
4: Testing -conducting various test to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements
5: Deployment -realeasing the software to users or customers
6: Maintenance -providing ongoing support,updates and enhancement to the software after deployment 

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall sequential approach with distinct phases flowing downwards like a waterfall while Agile iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change 
Both are suitable for different project types
Waterfall can be appropriate in implementation, requirements and designs while Agile can be appropriate in a project where collaboration between different teams is crucial


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
✓Software developer is responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions
✓Quality Assurance ensures software quality by designing and excuting test plans
✓Project manager oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software project

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environment provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing code for example visual studio, Eclipse,Intellij IDEA 
Version Control System is an important tool for tracking changes to a source code and coordinating work among team members for example Git and Subversion

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1: Changing requirements
2: Tight deadlines 
3: Technical Debt 
can be overcomed through effective communication,agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks and regular reassessment of project timelines and goals

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
✓Unit testing - testing individual components or module of software 
✓Integrated testing - testing interaction between different components of a subsystem
✓System testing - testing the entire software system as whole
✓Acceptance testing - testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Is Crafting questions or statements to get the best possible response from AI model
It's important in AI models is to improve accuracy and relevance by providing clear instructions and context through well crafted prompt

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
  "Tell me about the first president of Kenya"
  "Summarize an autobiography of Mzee Jomo Kenyatta
